# Pokemon Companion

## Project Summary
The project is intended to model the various elements a player will likely need to assist them
through a playthrough of a pokemon game, and help them strategize. These aspects include
various Pokemon, items, moves, locations, and opponents. The web application will help the
player plan out their teams throughout their playthrough, and track what teams their opponents have.
